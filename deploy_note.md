# Deployment Fixed

## Issues Resolved:
1. **Flask Version**: Downgraded to 2.2.5 to support `before_first_request`
2. **Model Loading**: Changed to load models on first request instead of startup
3. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for model loading

## Files Updated:
- `app.py` - Fixed Flask compatibility
- `requirements.txt` - Downgraded Flask version

## To Redeploy:
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. The service should start successfully now

## After Deployment:
- First request will be slow (loading models)
- Subsequent requests will be fast
- Update your `bark_service_url.txt` with the working URL
